# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
I used Mapbox to convey the earthquake data in relation to tectonic plates. All the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 and lines demarking the tectonic plates are on the map
## Results
I created three different tile layers for the end user to toggle between. The three different Mapbox styles are Dark, Satellite and Street Satellite. In addition, there is a legend conveying the color significance of each dot. The radius of each circle marker corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake. 
The layers allow the end user to focus on what theyâ€™d like to see on the map. A user can toggle between the following overlays: 

### Overlays:

## Conclusion

I used the live console to pinpoint my errors. I found this feedback useful when trouble shooting. The console feedback aided my understanding of mechanism of each line of code in the JavaScript files and the HTML file.
